# Innovation Day 2020 Project - SLAGHEAP
(Scheduled Local and Global Headlines, Events, And Puzzles)

The Goal: A backend application that scrapes RSS Feeds for headlines and emails me daily news updates.

<h4>Completed Tasks:</h4>
<ol>
<li>Make API Endpoint for accessing RSS Feed data</li>
<li>Email most recent stories from multiple feeds through API</li>
<li>Use Hangfire to send most recent stories as an email at 9:00am every day</li>
</ol>

<h4>Future Improvements to Make:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Find somewhere to run the program, so I can actually receive the emails;</li>
<li>Create API endpoint for adding new feeds/recipients (with URL parameters);</li>
<li>Get fancy with email formatting (e.g. show picture of one crossword instead of getting links to several?).</li>
</ul>
